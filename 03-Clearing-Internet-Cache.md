# Clearing the cache in your Internet browser
## Overview
At times, a Help Desk technician may ask you to clear the cache in your Internet browser. In fact, this action is often the first step to take when resolving any issues involving browsers, whether you are experiencing problems with applications that use them or your web sites just seem to be loading slowly. You can try clearing the cache on your own to see if it will solve the problem. Doing so is an easy and safe troubleshooting technique.  

To clear your cache, perform the following steps:
1. Exit any applications that you are accessing through your browser.
2. Choose one of the following options:
    - If you are using Microsoft Edge, go to the [“Clearing the Cache in Microsoft Edge”](https://github.com/kgulotta/Kenneth-Gulotta-Portfolio/blob/main/03-Clearing-Internet-Cache.md#clearing-the-cache-in-microsoft-edge) section.
    - If you are using Google Chrome, go to the “Clearing the Cache in Google Chrome” section.

## Clearing the cache in Microsoft Edge
1. In the Microsoft Edge window, click the **Settings and more** icon (the one that looks like an ellipsis) in the upper-right corner. Then, select the **Settings** option in the resulting menu.
