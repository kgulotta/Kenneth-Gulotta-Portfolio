## Using your PIV card for authentication
To log into both the agency network and Windows 11, you must use your PIV card to verify your identity and access rights. To do so, you must know how to insert your PIV card, when instructed, into a card reader installed in or attached to your system. Choose one of the following options:
- If you have an agency-issued laptop computer, use the PIV card reader that is built into it. Depending on your model, the PIV card slot may be on either the left or the right side of your laptop.

- If you have an agency-issued desktop computer, use a PIV card reader connected to it, such as a USB reader
or a keyboard reader.

## Connecting to the network and logging in with Windows 11 on-site
If you are logging into your system on-site at your agency, and it is connected by cable to the agency Local Area Network (LAN), you can log directly into Windows on it. To do so, perform the following steps:

1. Ensure that your computer is completely shut down. Then, insert your PIV card into your system’s card reader. For information, see the “Using Your PIV Card for Authentication” section.
2. Turn your computer on.
3. At the Windows opening screen, press the **CTRL-ALT-DELETE** key combination to continue.
4. At the agency “Notice to Users,” click the **OK** button.

5. At the “Other user” screen, click the **Sign-in options** link.

9. Wait while the system completes the Windows login process and presents the Windows desktop screen.

## Connecting to the network and logging in with Windows 11 from a remote location
If you are logging in from a remote location, and you need to access the agency’s network resources, you must log into the OPM Virtual Private Network (VPN) as well as Windows 11. To do so, perform the following steps:

1. Ensure that your computer is completely shut down. Then, insert your PIV card into your system’s card reader. For information, see the “Using Your PIV Card for Authentication” section.
2. Turn your computer on.
3. At the Windows opening screen, press the **CTRL-ALT-DELETE** key combination to continue.
4. At the agency “Notice to Users,” click the **OK** button.

5. If you need to connect your computer to wireless to access the Internet, do so by clicking the wireless network button in the lower-right corner of the Windows 11 system tray and following the connection prompts.  
  > :memo: **Note:** You must connect your computer to the Internet in order to access the OPM network.

  > :memo: **Note:** If the system does not present the “VPN: Ready to connect” prompt in the next step, choose one of the following options:
  > * To continue attempting to sign into the network, click the **Cancel** button, wait a few seconds, and click the **Network sign-in** button again. To ensure that you have full access to resources or if you have been instructed to perform a software upgrade, you should log into the VPN before you log into Windows.  
  > * To skip the network sign-in and log directly into Windows, click the **Cancel** button and go to Step 11.


5. At the “Other user” screen, click the **Sign-in options** link.
