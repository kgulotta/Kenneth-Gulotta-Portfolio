## Using your PIV card for authentication
To log into both the OPM network and Windows 11, you must use your PIV card to verify your identity and access rights. To do so, you must know how to insert your PIV card, when instructed, into a card reader installed in or attached to your system. Choose one of the following options:
- If you have an agency-issued laptop computer, use the PIV card reader that is built into it. Depending on your model, the PIV card slot may be on either the left or the right side of your laptop.

or a keyboard reader.

## Connecting to the network and logging in with Windows 11 on-site
If you are logging into your system on-site at your agency, and it is connected by cable to the OPM Local Area Network (LAN), you can log directly into Windows on it. To do so, perform the following steps:

1. Ensure that your computer is completely shut down. Then, insert your PIV card into your system’s card reader. For information, see the “Using Your PIV Card for Authentication” section.
2. Turn your computer on.
3. At the Windows opening screen, press the **CTRL-ALT-DELETE** key combination to continue.
4. At the OPM “Notice to Users,” click the **OK** button.
