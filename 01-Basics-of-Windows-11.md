### The Windows 11 taskbar
The Windows 11 taskbar gives you access to all the applications, settings, and files on your system. The new version is streamlined for easy access and centered in your system tray by default.  

The basic taskbar provides icons that enable you to access:
- The “start” menu.
- The “Search” interface.
- The “Task View” functions, which enable you to choose or create different desktops for managing specific sets of tasks or jobs.
- File Explorer.
- Microsoft Edge.

### Changes to the File Explorer interface
In Windows 11, File Explorer includes the functions you know from past versions, but with a new, simplified interface. Rather than navigating a Ribbon and menu system, you can access most of the basic functions directly through icons at the top of the window.  

For example, each File Explorer window includes icons that enable you to:
- Cut files or folders in preparation to paste them somewhere else.
- Copy files or folders.
- Paste files or folders in your current location.
- Rename files or folders.
- Share files or folders with colleagues.
- Delete files or folders.
- Choose how items are sorted in your current window.
- Choose a different presentation method for the items in your current window.  

  <img src="https://github.com/kgulotta/Kenneth-Gulotta-Portfolio/blob/main/Graphics/Basics-Windows-11/39-labelled-File-Explorer-icons.jpeg" alt="The labelled File Explorer window" style="width:40%; height:auto;">  

To create new folders or files in your current window, click the **New** button in the upperleft corner, and then select an option from the resulting drop-down menu.
